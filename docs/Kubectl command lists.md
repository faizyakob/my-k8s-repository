## Introduction

This article list useful kubectl commands separated by categories. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and I intended to make this a living document. 

## Using various "o" options

The "-o" option manipulates the output to show more, or less information, about a Kubernetes resource. It's useful if we want to limit the output, or only focus on specific property, for chaining the command to another.
