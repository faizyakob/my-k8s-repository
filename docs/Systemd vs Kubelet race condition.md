## Introduction
There is a particular issue related to race condition if you are running a local Kubernetes cluster locally. When a Linux VM is started from a power off state, or from a restart, the Kubelet can potentially initialize itself first, before _sytemd_ is able to initialize the VM's networking stack. <br>

When this happens, all pods will fail to run, and ended up in a broken cluster. 

Quick work around is to suspend the VMs when not in used, instead of shutting them down.

However, this can cause inconveniences to user, as in suspended state, the VM will still consume the host's RAM. 

## Details
üò°
When a system boots, _systemd_ starts services in parallel.<br>
By default:

- The network interface may not yet have an IP address (especially if DHCP is used).
- Kubelet may start early (because it‚Äôs often configured with After=network.target, which does not guarantee network connectivity, only that the network stack is up).

If Kubelet starts before the network interface is online:

+ It can‚Äôt register with the API server (because there‚Äôs no IP yet).
+ It may fail to bind to its node IP.
+ It may enter a crash loop or delay node readiness.

When this happened, CNI pods (Cilium, for example) won't be able to run, which will result in Kubernetes cluster becomes unusable. All other workload pods will fail to run as well because the pods networking is non-existence. 

This is applicable if you follow steps in [Create local Kubernetes cluster](<Create local Kubernetes cluster.md>) to build your own Kubernetes cluster. Clusters hosted on the cloud are less susceptible, being their nodes are always running. 

## Mitigation
üòá
The fix, is to make Kubelet waits until the networking stack is fully initialized. 

### Step 1: Enable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service

Using sudo or root, run command:
```
systemctl enable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
```

<br>


This enables the `systemd-networkd-wait-online` service, which blocks until all configured network interfaces are up and online before continuing boot dependencies that require the network.

In short, it ensures:

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start anything that depends on the network until it‚Äôs actually online.‚Äù

Without this, `network-online.target` may be reached too early (before DHCP assigns an IP).

### Step 2: Adding to Kubelet‚Äôs systemd unit

Using sudo or root, run command:
```
systemctl edit kubelet
```
Add the following lines in the designated section of the service file.

```
[Unit]
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 15
```

What this does:
+ `After=network-online.target`
Ensures Kubelet starts after the network is marked ‚Äúonline‚Äù (which now depends on `systemd-networkd-wait-online.service` from Step 1).

+ `Wants=network-online.target`
Ensures that the network-online target is pulled in (started) if it‚Äôs not already.

+ `ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 15`
Adds an extra delay (15 seconds) before starting Kubelet ‚Äî a practical workaround for environments where the network may take a bit longer to stabilize (e.g., cloud VMs, DHCP, or CNI initialization).

## Outro

Once mitigation is configured, Kubelet will wait until the network stack is fully ready before starting itself. 
CNI pods will properly run soon after, and subsequently other pods. 

This will allow users to shutdown their VMs when not in used, and just turning them bacl on per case basis. 

> Tips: Always start the master or control plane node first, wait for couple of minutes, then only start the worker nodes.
